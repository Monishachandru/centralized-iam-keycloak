# Week 2 – Single Sign-On (SSO) and RBAC

## Summary

This phase focused on enabling centralized authentication and authorization using **Single Sign-On (SSO)** and **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** with Keycloak.

## Work Completed

* Configured Keycloak clients using OpenID Connect (OIDC)
* Implemented Single Sign-On for centralized authentication
* Defined roles including **admin**, **developer**, and **viewer**
* Mapped roles to users through group-based role assignments

## IAM Concepts Applied

* OpenID Connect (OIDC)
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Centralized authentication and authorization

## Outcome

Users can authenticate once and securely access resources based on assigned roles, reducing credential duplication and enforcing least-privilege access.
