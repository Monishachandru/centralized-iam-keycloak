# Week 2 – Single Sign-On (SSO) and RBAC

## Work Done
- Configured Keycloak client using OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- Implemented Single Sign-On (SSO) for centralized authentication
- Created roles such as admin, developer, and viewer
- Mapped roles to users using group-based role assignment

## IAM Concepts Applied
- OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Centralized authentication and authorization

## Outcome
Users can authenticate once and gain access based on assigned roles, eliminating multiple credentials and enforcing least-privilege access.
